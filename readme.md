# NimbleLang

NimbleLang is a tiny, type-safe programming language for making 2D games and visualisations with HTML5 Canvas.

It compiles to javascript and sets up all of the plumbing for rendering and initialising your canvas.

This means that there is no further work from running a NimbleLang script to seeing
your output in the browser.

## Features

- Typesafe
- Type inference
- Simple syntax
- Pre-defined entry points (setup, render, draw, keypress, etc)
- Standard library with:
    - pre-made types (e.g. vec2, vec3, color)
    - useful libraries (e.g. math, physics, noise, etc)
